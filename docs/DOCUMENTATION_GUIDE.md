# Documentation Guidelines

## Starting a New Project

The dashboards-anywhere repository hosts multi-projects. This documentation guidelines are for the developers who start a new project.

From here it's recommended to follow a few patterns.

```
# Docs Folder Structure

├── projects
|      ├── playground
|      |       ├── design.md
|      |       └── other doc

```

## Documentation Format

We suggest to use markdown file as documentation format, it can be easy to use or reference by other sites.
